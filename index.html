                <h1>Microbreweries</h1>
                <p>Although the term "microbrewery" was originally used in relation to the size of breweries,
                    it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility,
                    adaptability,
                    experimentation and customer service. The term and trend spread to the US in the 1980s and was
                    eventually
                    used as a designation of breweries that produce fewer than 15,000 U.S. beer barrels (1,800,000
                    liters; 460,000 U.S. gallons) annually.</p>

                <P>Microbreweries gradually appeared in other countries, such as New Zealand and Australia. Craft beer
                    and microbreweries were cited as
                    the reason for a 15 million L (4.0 million US gal) drop in alcohol sales in New Zealand over 2012,
                    with New Zealanders preferring
                    higher-priced premium beers over cheaper brands.</p>

                <h1>Nanobreweries</h1>
                <p>The website The Food Section defines a "nanobrewery" as "a scaled-down microbrewery, often run by a
                    solo entrepreneur, that produces
                    beer in small batches." The US Department of the Treasury defines nanobreweries as "very small
                    brewery operations" that produce beer for sale.</p>

                <h1>Craft Brewery</h1>
                <p>"Craft brewing" is a more encompassing term for developments in the industry succeeding the
                    microbrewing movement of the late 20th century.
                    The definition is not entirely consistent but typically applies to relatively small, independently
                    owned commercial breweries that employ traditional
                    brewing methods and emphasize flavor and quality. The term is usually reserved for breweries
                    established since the 1970s but may be used for older
                    breweries with a similar focus.</p>

                <h1>Canned Beer</h1>
                <p>The use of cans by craft brewers doubled between 2012 and 2014, with over 500 companies in the United
                    States using cans to package their beverages.
                    Previously associated with the major brewing corporations, cans are now favored by craft brewers for
                    numerous reasons: cans are impervious to oxygen,
                    beer-degrading light does not affect canned beer, canned beer is more portable since less room is
                    required for storage or transportation, canned beer cools
                    more quickly, and cans have a greater surface area for wraparound designs and decorations</p>
                <p>The perception that bottles lead to a taste that is superior to canned beer is outdated, as most
                    aluminum cans are lined with a polymer coating that
                    protects the beer from the problematic metal. However, since drinking directly from a can may still
                    result in a metallic taste, most craft brewers recommend
                    pouring beer into a glass prior to consumption. In June 2014, the BA estimated 3% of craft beer is
                    sold in cans, 60% is sold in bottles, and kegs represent the
                    remainder of the market</p>

                <h1>Barrel Aged Beer</h1>
                <p>Goose Island first produced its Bourbon County Stout in 1992, but it wasn't regularly available until
                    2005. Other breweries began following Goose Island’s lead,
                    typically aging rich imperial stouts such as Founders KBS and The Bruery's Black Tuesday. In 2018,
                    Food and Drink wrote: "A process that was once niche has become
                    not just mainstream, but ubiquitous." Barrel-aged sour beers are a newer trend, inspired by the
                    Belgian tradition of lambics and Flanders red ale</p>

                <h1>Non-alcoholic craft beers</h1>
                <p>The market for non-alcoholic beer and wine in North America is predicted to quadruple from a base of
                    about $20 million in 2018. Brooklyn Brewery are among the
                    early craft breweries prepared to release a non-alcoholic craft beer, with their "Special Effects".
                    Examples in Europe include Mikkeller's "Drink'in The Sun" and
                    Nirvana's gluten-free "Kosmic Stout".</p>

                <p>The most famous opening line in all of literature is: “In the beginning, God …” In writing about
                    craft beer, a fitting opening line would be: “In the beginning,
                    Fritz Maytag …” Maytag did not, ex nihilo, create a new malt beverage. In fact, Maytag’s brewing
                    firm, the Anchor Steam Beer Company, had been in existence since 1896,
                    well before he took ownership of the company in 1965. Maytag’s innovation was in reconstituting a
                    fading company and a dying product. In the course of doing so, he personified
                    “the beginning” of the craft beer segment of the malt beverage industry. Although Maytag’s
                    pioneering endeavors took place in the United States, his influence on the market for
                    beer has been global. Maytag and others who followed undermined the hypothesis that the U.S. beer
                    industry was destined to have a highly concentrated market structure, a homogeneous
                    output (i.e., lager beer), and be insulated from the prospect of new entrants to the market.
                </p>
                <p id="quote">The term “craft beer” (or “craft beer segment”) is a portmanteau expression that merits
                    unpacking. In his history of craft beer, Tom Acitelli defines a craft brewery this way:
                    <p><i>of brewery includes any small, independently owned brewery that adheres to traditional brewing
                            practices and ingredients. Craft brewers are distinct from larger regional
                            and national breweries, which often use nontraditional ingredients and brew on a much vaster
                            scale.</i></p>
                </p>
                <p>This definition incorporates the two variables that distinguish or define craft beer: the type of
                    beer and the size of the production facility (although both metrics, “kind” and “size,” 4
                    are elastic). By type of beer, craft beer can mean different varieties of beer—ale, stout, porter,
                    even lager—but never brewed with adjuncts or artificial ingredients. The trade group for
                    craft brewers, the Brewers Association, defined a craft brewer as:
                    <p><i>
                            small, independent and traditional. Small means brewing less than 6 million barrels per
                            year, the federal limit for the small brewers excise tax exemption. Independent means that
                            less than 25% of
                            the brewery is owned by a non-craft brewer. Traditional refers to a focus on beers that are
                            made entirely or mostly from malt, and not diluted with adjuncts like corn or rice.
                        </i></p>
                </p>
                <p>To many consumers, craft beer is associated with the small scale of the brewing facility:
                    microbreweries and brewpubs.2 Home brewing is an extreme example of small-scale production and
                    vertical
                    integration. In the taxonomy of craft beer production, there also is the nanobrewery, which, unlike
                    home brewers, brews beer for resale but on a very small scale.</p>

            <a name="Ingredients" id="Ingredients"></a>
            <p>Here, the overall craft-brewing process will be described. Note that this is a general process that can
                vary by producer and batch. The 4 main ingredients are water, barley/grains/cereals, hops,
                and yeast. Typically, utility water is filtered to purify it before use. If the source water is very
                soft, a brewer may add gypsum (calcium sulfate), Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), calcium chloride,
                table salt (sodium chloride), and/or chalk (calcium carbonate). Magnesium, and particularly calcium,
                affect yeast metabolism, while bicarbonates alter pH.
            </p>
            <p>The <strong><i>malted</i></strong> barley/grains are the source of starch for the sugar production, used
                in fermentation later. Malting refers to the process of allowing the cereals to germinate part way, then
                drying to
                stop the process. The purpose of this is to allow the enzymes that break down the endosperm starches to
                be released without much being consumed by the germination process. Typically, they soak in water
                for several days and are then drained, and dried. The cereal grain and sub varieties affect flavor,
                color, and aroma, as does the option of roasting, toasting, and/or smoking the grains. Adjuncts,
                non-germinated grains added separately, may also be added if additional starch is called for. It should
                be noted that most brewers buy malted-to-order barley due to the benefits of economics and
                required expertise coinciding with scale.
            </p>
            <p><strong><i>Hops</i></strong> release oils that provide some flavor and aroma, while inhibiting some
                spoiling bacteria.There is an incredibly wide variety of hops to choose from, and when they are added
                and for how
                long they are left to seep are all factors leveraged by recipes. The iconic bitterness from hops
                originates from the Alpha Acid resins, and International Bitterness Units (IBUs) is the standard used in
                calculations.
            </p>
            <p><strong><i>Yeast</i></strong> is the active culture that causes fermentation and is essential to the
                brew. They typically are in two categories: Top fermenting, which produces ale, and bottom fermenting,
                which produces lagers; top and bottom denotes whether the yeast floats or sinks. The yeast can be stored
                in dry form, which is easy to store and transport, or as a liquid, which enables a wider use
                of varieties and can obtain enhanced consistency. Cultures can be purchased (typically dried) or
                maintained in-house (though this is usually limited to larger brewers).</p>

                    <li>Stages</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mash</li>
                        <p>The first step in the brewing process is to produce the mash. The purpose of this step is to
                            convert the starches in the grains into fermentable sugars. Beforehand, the kernels need to be
                            crushed. Within limits, the finer they are broken, the more sugar can be obtained. However, if
                            the grains are too small, water will not be able to permeate the grains, known as a stuck mash.
                            Care must also be taken during processing to avoid a stuck run-off, which is when the water line
                            is below the gain line, and the weight of the grains crush the bottom layer into an impermeable
                            layer. These two “stuck” s are less of an issue if using a separate kettle for the mash. The grains
                            are then put into a Mash-lauter-tun (or just a kettle) and soak in hot water, sprayed by the
                            hydrator, to activate the various enzymes. The primary enzymes of interest are the Alpha and
                            Beta Amylase enzymes, which work best at different temperature and pH ranges. Beta Amylase
                            *-*(ideal range of 126-144F) is the heart of the process, as it snips segments of the starches into
                            glucose. This process is greatly sped-up with the Alpha Amylase (ideal range of 149-153F),
                            which cleaves the long starch segments, increasing the number of sites for the Beta enzyme to
                            work. Limit dextrin’s are produced as a byproduct, which are starch segments with branching
                            behavior enzymes cannot break down but are typically destroyed in the mashing process. Note
                            that grain/sugar adjuncts may be added according to recipe.
                            Early in the mash, an acid rest may be performed by lowering the water temp in order to lower
                            pH, a step typically done if the water used is very soft with no additives to counter it, or if the
                            water chemistry is unknown. 15-30 minutes in a protein rest is typically done by reducing the
                            temperature to 113-131F, which allows the various protein chains to break down. The time and
                            temperatures involved in this step, along with almost all others in the brewing process, depend
                            on the recipe used. For the mash process, the time spent soaking is a spectrum starting with a full
                            (high starch) brew with ultimately low alcohol with short time frame, to the inverse with a high
                            soak time. The temperature behavior of the mash process can be broadly be categorized as
                            follows: Infusion is where there is a single temperature is held. Decoction is where boiling water
                            is added, and periodically some water and grist is removed, brought to boiling, and re added to
                            keep temperature up. This technique was standard when good temperature measurement was
                            beyond practical means. Temperature Control is where there are consecutive temperature
                            increases, best used with under-modified malts.</p>
                        <li>Lautering and Sparging</li>
                        <p>Next is the Lautering and Sparging steps. The purpose is to remove the sugars from the
                            grain husks and retrieve the sugar water. It should be noted that this step may or may not be in
                            the mash-lauter-tun, if a kettle was used for the mash (typical of very small brewing operations,
                            such as homebrew), then this step uses a lauter unit. The temperature is first raised to around
                            170F to stop enzyme activity. In the lautering step, the unit is drained, and the liquid is poured
                            over the mash to extract more sugar, while the husks themselves act as a filter to remove larger
                            particulates. The following sparging step has the sugar-water drained, while fresh heated water
                            pours over the gains to extract even more sugar, suppress enzymes further, and to prevent a stuck
                            run-off.</p>
                        <li>Boil Kettle: Wort Production</li>
                        <p>The sweet sugar water is then transferred to the Boil Kettle. The purpose is to condense
                            the sugar water into wort and to kill off any unwanted bacteria. Typically, a steam jacketed brew
                            kettle is used to boil approximately 90 minutes. During that time, some hops are added at various
                            stages for different effects. Boiling hops are added early, where the extracted oils add bitterness.
                            Oils that contribute to flavor and aroma are volatile and boil off easily, so flavor hops are usually
                            added around the last 15-minute mark, while aroma hops are added in the last few. There may be
                            an oxygen control system, so that the yeast my grow but is not competed with by other bacteria.
                            The wort produced can be concentrated to become malt, which with the addition of water can be
                            used to brew. In this stage, other adjuncts, primarily for flavor and aroma, may be added per
                            recipe. </p>
                        <li>Cooling Wort</li>
                        <p>The next stage is separation and cooling, the purpose of which is to remove undesired
                            solids and prepare for fermentation. The wort is vortexed in the kettle, where the hops/solids,
                            called turb, collects in the center, and is left to slow to a stop and solids settle at the bottom
                            (flocculation). The clean wort is then quickly cooled to a proper temperature for the yeast. Rapid
                            cooling is essential for several reasons: prolonged idle time increases the chance of
                            contamination, existing biological contamination will have more time to grow before yeast is

                            added, hot wort can produce dimethyl sulfides, and can react with oxygen to produce more off
                            flavors, which both affect taste. The cooling is done often with a liquid-liquid heat exchanger,
                            where the water used for cooling is used as pre-heated water for the next batch’s mash (around
                            170F). This cooling water is transferring from a “cold” liquor tank to a “hot” one, which are only
                            regular tanks with no alcohol, despite the name.

                        <li>Fermentation</li>
                        <p>Now alcohol production via fermentation can begin. Ideal time and temperature vary
                            according to recipe; for example, Ales typically need 2 weeks at 68F, while lagers need 6 weeks
                            at 48F. There are two stages to fermentation: the primary stage has exponential growth of yeast
                            from the ample supply of simple sugars, and foaming (krausen) from rigorous CO2 production.
                            In the secondary stage, heavy fats, proteins, and inactive yeast settle to the bottom of the tank,
                            CO2 production slows dramatically, and yeast levels fall as only heavier, complex starches
                            remain for consumption. Some brewers may have separate tanks for these two stages, though this
                            is not typical.
                            The CO2 production causes the beer to partially self-carbonate, which has the secondary effect
                            of inhibiting contaminate growth. The alcohol content can indirectly be be measured by
                            identifying its specific gravity with a hydrometer. Alcohol content is one attribute that may be
                            used to determine the stop time. A refractometer can measure the alcohol content directly while
                            also being easier to calibrate and uses very little product. However, it often has a prohibitive upfront cost. 
                            Once fermentation is completed, it is cooled, sometimes to near freezing, to help settle
                            the yeast and undesired proteins. From there, the beer is slowly pumped out (to avoid disturbing
                            the settled material) and possibly filtered. Craft brewers often abstain from filtering, believing
                            the quality control/consistency is not worth the change in taste, expense, and maintenance.
                            Because the fermentation process produces heat, some form of cooling is necessary. This is often
                            in the form of jacketed vessels with flowing coolant, namely water or ethylene glycol.
                            Fermenters have a cone shaped bottom to collect yeast and other particulates that sink. The
                            vessels are also sealed with one-way valves that let CO2 escape while keeping oxygen and
                            contaminates out, usually a water trap. The vessel needs to have extra space between the liquid
                            level and vessel top (ullage) so that the foam (krausen) does not overflow. Furthermore, yeast 
                            may be recovered to start a new batch. Mutations limit the number of times this can be done to
                            once or twice.</p>
                        <li>Brite Tank</li>
                        <p>The beer can then enter the Brite Tank, which is a vessel to add in extra CO2. Usually,
                            canistered CO2 is purchased separately, and the gas is broken into smaller bubbles by a device,
                            such as a bubbling stone, to conserve gas and time.</p>
                        <li>Packaging</li>
                        <p>The last step is to package the beer in cans, glasses, kegs, etc. Beyond ease of
                            transportation, the containers keep out oxygen, sunlight, and stray contaminate that my alter the
                            beer in shipment or storage. If the beer was not previously carbonated with the brite tank, it may
                            be during the packaging process via priming, kraesening, or injection. Priming is when a water,
                            sugar, and dry malt extract mixture is added to reactivate remaining yeast, producing some CO2.
                            However, this comes with the risk of adding new flavors. Premade priming tablets can be
                            purchased to be added to the bottles or batch and is usually used by homebrews rather than craft
                            brew. Kraesening is where unfermented wort from earlier in the process (gyle) is added as it
                            would in priming. This greatly reduces the chance of changing the taste, but the sugar content
                            can vary, and the amount added should be adjusted accordingly. The last method is to simply
                            inject pressurized CO2 while filling. The filling process for bottles, kegs, and cans are similar in
                            procedure. The container is rinsed/disinfected, dried, flushed with CO2 to drive out air, partially
                            pressurized with CO2 to suppress foaming, filled, and capped. Some systems may not pressurize
                            CO2 and may opt to use a water jet to cause slight foaming, which helps push air out. In either
                            case, the bottle is not filled to the brim, as some CO2 headspace helps keep the drink carbonated</p>
